⌨️ KeyLogger with Screenshot Association :

📌 Description :

This project is an educational Python application that records keyboard activity and periodically captures screenshots with explicit user consent.
The program associates keystrokes with corresponding screenshots based on time intervals.

🧠 Project Purpose :

The goal of this project is to understand:

Keyboard event handling

Multithreading in Python

Screenshot automation

Time-based data association

Ethical data collection with user consent

🧰 Technologies Used :

Python

pynput (keyboard listener)

pyautogui (screenshots)

tkinter (GUI & consent dialog)

Threading & datetime modules

⚙️ Features :

User consent popup before execution

Keyboard logging with timestamps

Screenshot capture at fixed intervals

Automatic session folder creation

Association of keystrokes with screenshots

Multithreaded execution

▶️ How It Works :

The user is asked for consent before logging begins

Keyboard input is recorded with timestamps

Screenshots are taken at regular intervals

Keystrokes occurring between screenshots are associated and logged

All data is stored in a session-specific folder

🔐 Ethical Notice :

This project is created strictly for educational and learning purposes.
User consent is mandatory, and the application should only be used in controlled, authorized environments.

🎓 Learning Outcome :

By completing this project, one gains hands-on experience with:

Event-driven programming

Thread synchronization

File handling and logging

Ethical considerations in system-level programming
